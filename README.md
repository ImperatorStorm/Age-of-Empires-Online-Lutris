## General info
Age of Empires Online has been revived in mid-2017 under a non-commercial license under Microsoft's "Game Content Usage Rules" by an independent group of developers (Project Celeste). It can be played on a server emulator known as "Project Celeste" with all online features fully enabled, for free without any player limitations!
The team uses Microsoft's publicly released development-kit to balance, fix bugs, and expand the content where Microsoft's team left off.
